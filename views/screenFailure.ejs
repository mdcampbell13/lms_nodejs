        <p class="lead">We have a variety of screen rental packages for your private get together or public event, whatever the size.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Our screen packages are a perfect economical alternative to renting equipment if you have a movie night or short event in mind. We include the screen, 5,000 lumen large-venue projector, sound system and staff during your event. Great solutions for patio and deck parties to large field parties. We even have generators available for an additional fee so if you have a large open space available and no power, we've got your covered. Customers can also connect up their game consoles or customer owned equipment for game-nights on our giant screens!</p>
        <p>We start set-up 2 hours prior to sunset and play customer chosen content on our sound systems until the start of your main content. Please keep in mind that bright nearby light sources can effect the picture quality.</p>
        <p>We provide a "no touch" service with all of our equipement that might come into contact with our customers either UVC sterilized as with our FM receivers or wiped down intiseptically as with our rental equipment. We follow all CDC guidlines. The safety and wellbeing of our customers is our #1 priority.</p>
